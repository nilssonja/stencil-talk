<h2>What are Web Components?</h2>

<p>"Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom,
    reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps." - <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction">webcomponents.org</a>

As a whole, Web Components are based on four major specifications: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM,
ES Modules, and the HTML template element. Generally speaking, when you hear somone refering to Web Components
it is likely they are talking about the Custom Elements spec. It is worth noting that the
Custom Elements spec was created as a means to standardize how to build non-standard HTML Elements
in a way modern browsers understand.
