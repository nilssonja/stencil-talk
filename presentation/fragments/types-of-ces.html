According to the spec, there are two types of custom elements. The first is an Autonomous
custom element which is defined entirely by the author. That is to say they do not extend the functionality
of known existing HTML elements and are entirely original. It is up to the author to define the behavior and style
of the element from scratch.

The second type of custom element is the customized built-in element. These custom elements are designed
to extend the functionality of an existing HTML element chosen by the author. This part of the spec
is still a work in progress and only supported by Chrome.

So, to drill down even further, when people are referring to custom elements today they are likely
talking about autonomous custom elements, specifically.
